## 2014 boilerplate

Build on Yeoman, Bower and Grunt:

* Meta data: Name of lead developer.
* Installation guide.
clone repo

From terminal
npm install
bower install
grunt serve

* Dependencies (like nodejs, ruby, grunt, bower and compass).
* Explanation about patterns or frameworks in use (like backbone or other internal framework, with link to further documentation).
* Relevant knowledge (did you hack an external library again?)
